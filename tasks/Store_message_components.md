# Store message components
Decide how to store all of the message components for your game.

Think about what kind of data structures would work best to store the information. An array would be a good choice here because you can randomly access an arrayâ€™s elements. Remember, there will be at least 3 sets of data that make up your final message so you might consider having multiple arrays. You may want to nest these arrays inside of an object to keep them organized.
