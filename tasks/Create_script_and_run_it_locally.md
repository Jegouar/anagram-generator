# Create script and run it locally
On your computer, create a JavaScript file to write your code in. Make sure you are able to run your script locally in Node.

Create a `script.js` file and try logging some text to the console.

In your terminal, navigate into your project directory and run your script in Node. You should see the text you wrote being printed to the terminal window. You can run your script at any point throughout this project to test it.
