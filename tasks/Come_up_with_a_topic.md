Decide on what types of messages you want your program to output.

Think about what kinds of messages you’d like your program to output. Is it a horoscope generator? A fortune teller? An inspiring phrase? Knock-knock jokes? Here’s an example of what the output of a horoscope generator could look like:
```
Your sign is sun.
 
You are having good luck. 

You should: "trust no one"
```
Remember, to make your program truly random the message should really be made up of multiple strings that are output together.

Think about what parts of the string could stay the same each time and what parts could change. In the output above, what do you think are the pieces that change each time?
